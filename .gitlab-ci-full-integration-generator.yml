# Ideally we would have used "parallel: $CI_JOBS_IN_PARALLEL_INTEGRATION" to run the tests, but it
# is not supported to use an integer variable here. Do a blame on these lines for more context.
#
# To workaround this issue, we set up "Dynamic child pipelines" to control how many CI jobs to
# run tests (iow how many child pipelines) to launch. For an overview of this features see:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/downstream_pipelines.html#dynamic-child-pipelines
#
# And how is really implemented? Using envsubst to set the values of CI_NODE_TOTAL and CI_NODE_INDEX
# in the template pipeline file for each desired child job, and concatenate all of them.
