## mender 3.1.0

_Released 09.28.2021_

### Changelogs

#### mender (3.1.0)

New changes in mender since 3.0.0:

* Extend logs for docker module
* Add artifact_name to device provides if not found in store
* Support passing docker run CLI arguments when deploying
  an artifact using the `docker` _update module_.
* Implement support for non-U-Boot tool names.

  The tools still have to be command line compatible with the U-Boot
  tools (either u-boot-fw-utils or libubootenv), but the names can be
  different. This allows having U-Boot tools installed alongside
  grub-mender-grubenv tools, whose new names are
  `grub-mender-grubenv-set` and `grub-mender-grubenv-print`, instead of
  `fw_setenv` and `fw_printenv`.

  The two new configuration settings `BootUtilitiesSetActivePart` and
  `BootUtilitiesGetNextActivePart` have been introduced to configure the
  names. If no names are set, then the default is to try the
  grub-mender-grubenv tools first, followed by the "fw_" tools if the
  former are not found.
  ([MEN-3978](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/browse/MEN-3978))
* Add missing filesystem sync which could produce an empty or
  corrupted Update Module file tree in
  `/var/lib/mender/modules/v3/payloads/0000/tree/files/` after an
  unexpected reboot.
* If the mender.conf file has a new server URL or tenant token, the
  client will now remove the cached authorization token upon the next restart of
  the dameon, and hence respect the new configuration, as opposed to letting it
  expire, which was the old functionality.

* [FIX] Fetch geo location data once per power cycle
